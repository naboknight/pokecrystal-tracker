4. Settings options for various randomization features

It is recommended to turn on Fast Tool Tips to see the descriptions of the items and settings options

### Settings Options

If the option is crossed out, it is disabled and not part of the logic of the tracker.

1. ![Full Item](images/other/full_item.png "Full Item") All items are randomized, otherwise only Key Items are randomized. This does not include PokeGear, PokeGear Cards, Pokedex, or Rainbow Wing (see the other options below for these).
2. ![Ilex Cut Tree](images/other/cut_tree.png "Ilex Cut Tree") The tree in Ilex Forest is present, requiring access to Cut to pass.
3. ![Vanilla Clair](images/other/vanilla_clair.png "Vanilla Clair") Clair forces you to go to Dragon's Den and pass the test before giving you the badge and item (requires Surf and Whirlpool).
4. ![Elite Four Required](images/other/trophy.png "Elite Four Required") Fighting the Elite Four is required for Red to appear.
5. ![Backward Kanto](images/other/backward_kanto.png "Backward Kanto") Going into Western Kanto via the Victory Road gate is in logic (requires Surf, Waterfall, and waking up Snorlax, which requires the PokeGear, Radio Card, and Expansion Card).
6. ![Random Pokedex](images/items/pokedex.png "Random Pokedex") The Pokedex is added to the randomized item pool.
7. ![Random Pokegear](images/items/pokegear.png "Random Pokegear") The PokeGear is added to the randomized item pool.
8. ![Random Radio Cards](images/items/radio_card.png "Random Radio Cards") The Radio Card and Expansion Card are added to the randomized item pool.
9. ![Tin Tower and Ho-oh Chamber](images/other/tin_tower.png "Tin Tower and Ho-oh Chamber") The Rainbow Wing is added to the randomized item pool. Tin Tower and the Ho-oh Treasure Room are in logic. Access to the base of Tin Tower requires the Clear Bell and access to the upper floors requires the Rainbow Wing. Ho-oh spawns once the Elite Four have been defeated. The Ho-oh Treasure Chamber opens when Ho-oh has been defeated (requires Surf and Strength).

### Settings Presets

Presets have been added under the gear icon at the top right of the item tracker, corresponding with the presets in ERC's Item Randomizer.

1. ![Standard Full Item](images/presets/standard_full.png "Standard Full Item") Standard Full Item randomizer.
2. ![Easy Full Item](images/presets/easy_full.png "Easy Full Item") Easy Full Item randomizer (same as Standard, but with a few Easy settings, see below).
3. ![Old Standard Full Item](images/presets/old_standard_full.png "Old Standard Full Item") Old Standard Full Item randomizer (same as Standard, but Ilex Cut Tree is not removed).
4. ![Tricky/Extreme Full Item](images/presets/tricky_full.png "Tricky/Extreme Full Item") Tricky or Extreme Full Item randomizer (adds PokeGear, Radio/Expansion Cards, Pokedex, and Tin Tower to logic).
4. ![Nightmare Full Item](images/presets/nightmare_full.png "Nightmare Full Item") Nightmare Full Item randomizer. Do you like fun? Well, too bad.
5. ![Vintage Full Item](images/presets/vintage_full.png "Vintage Full Item") Vintage Full Item randomizer (replicates vanilla Crystal as close as possible).
6. ![Easy/Classic Key Item](images/presets/classic_key.png "Easy/Classic Key Item") Classic or Easy Key Item randomizer (see below for Easy variant information).
7. ![Neo/Extreme Key Item](images/presets/neo_key.png "Neo/Extreme Key Item") Neo or Extreme Key Item randomizer (new twists on Key Item Randomizer).

The Extreme variants mixes badges into the item pool. This does not change how the tracker operates, but is noted here for convenience.\
The Easy variants guarantee early Fly access (follows early Bicycle logic), Backwards Kanto is never required, and none of the Kanto Gym leaders (except Janine) will be required until access to 7 other badges.

Note: After using these presets, you can further customize your settings options as normal.
